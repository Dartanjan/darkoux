				<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
				<p>I optimized previous app information architecture to give right information at the right time, while keeping focus on each location's photograph, as the key trigger.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
				<h3>Prototype</h3>
				<p>I used Axure RP to create an interactive prototype and communicate to both the client and the developer how app should work.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
				<h3>UI Design</h3>
				<p>In the end, I created the visual language that puts strong emphasis on photography and typography, as a supplement to the primary audio content. This way, I aimed at experience beyond just an audio player.</p>

				<p>CitizenShipper is an online marketplace that connects people in need of shipping with drivers who are already going the same way. For almost a year, I was re-thinking UX of several large product areas.</p>

			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2">
				<h3>Insights</h3>
				<p>I helped CS capture better data in Google Analytics, and I used this data to bring informed design decisions. For specific needs I turned to MySQL and wrote over a dozen queries to extract behavior-focused data.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2">
				<h3>Conceptual</h3>
				<p>I completely reimagined driver and shipper dashboards, as well as some tools that haven't yet made it to the site. My primary target was to cut down on time between new shipments and accepted drivers.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2">
				<h3>Prototype</h3>
				<p>In Axure RP, I created highly interactive prototypes for various screens. For certain interactions I even created code prototypes -- big part of the code was later used in production.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2">
				<h3>UI &amp; IA</h3>
				<p>Beyond wireframes, I designed interfaces for the new app screens. I aimed for clean, functional design that works well on various screen sizes. This required heavy information restructure.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2">
				<h3>Product Design</h3>
				<p>Over time, I developed high level of attachment, along with insight into the product, customers and the market. This allowed me to develop product vision and feature ideas beyond my regular UX duties.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2">
				<h3>Code</h3>
				<p>As the core team was small, I often took role of UX Developer, working on both PHP and HTML, CSS and Javascript. This dramatically decreased time to deploy small UI changes.</p>

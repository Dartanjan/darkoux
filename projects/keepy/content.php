        <p>Keepy is the new way for families to save &amp; share memories. On Keepy, I was tasked with improving key conversions on two areas of the mobile app: onboarding and paywall.</p>

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>A big part of both projects was to reorganize information, make it clearer, more concise and more useful. The goal was to provide right information at the right time, removing superfluous steps and overall clutter.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>To communicate the changes I wanted to make, I built two prototypes: one in Axure RP for the user flows, and another in Pixate, to show some of the finer detail of user interactions on actual devices.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
        <h3>Data insight</h3>
        <p>The new flow decreased the time needed to get users to the main screen, but further iterations were required to improve key conversions. During this time I was actively monitoring data in Mixpanel and worked with the team on creating these iterations.</p>

        <h3>UI visual design</h3>
        <p>To aid users in understanding the product and the next steps they need to take, I proposed a few minor changes to app's visual design. The goal was to improve usability and clarity, reducing cognitive load which existing icons were creating.</p>

        <p>After inspecting the existing onboarding flow and brainstorming on how it can be optimized, I built user flow schematics. User flows are a great way to communicate how system should work from user's point of view. A few iterations brought everyone on the same page &ndash; developers, marketer and copywriter, Q&amp;A &ndash; so the project could be executed with less friction.</p>

        <p>Variations on a couple of app icons: notifications, list view, grid view, secondary actions menu. These are heavily based on Material design icons, which was done to further reduce customer's cognitive load of learning new tools, patterns and metaphors. The reason I proposed these changes was because the icons represented some of the actions which new customers were supposed to use or learn after signing up.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h3>Understanding data</h3>
        <p>Although the app utilized Mixpanel analytics, at times it was very difficult, even impossible to come to clear conclusion on whether the (re)design made positive or negative changes. This is not pleasant as it does not lead to validated learning and gives too much room to subjective decision-making.</p>
        <h3>Balancing the onboarding process</h3>
        <p>Onboarding is difficult to crack. A concrete challenge was to balance between getting the customer to the main screen as soon as possible &ndash; so that they experience the app themselves &ndash; and taking them by hand through several steps to make sure they create their first "keepy." For me, the first method felt better, but more difficult to execute right (requires that UVP is both very attractive and is clearly communicated). The second method ensures they create their first keepy, which in theory means they should experience the UVP sooner, but it could also create a false sense of engagement: customer completed a goal only because we made him do it, not because he understood the value and expressed genuine interest. </p>
        <p>This juggling between less intense onboarding, hinting at what the UVP is and what the next steps are, and making sure the customer goes through key processes, is a classical onboarding challenge. The existing complex onboarding user flow, and the expectations around it, only made it a bit more tricky.</p>

        <p>This is the final, UI visual design output with some variations, of the paywall project. The goal was to rethink how and when payment notice is triggered, and to improve conversions for the checkout page. One of the issues I encountered was that it wasn't clear what "Unlimited" or "Premium" precisely meant for the customer. Existing checkout screen was refactored into a page that looks more like a landing page communicating key benefits of upgrading. Also, a friendly notice focusing on positive ("enjoy all the benefits today") instead of negative ("you have reached the limit") was created to set customer's expectations about the system. This way, the payment stress is a little less intense once it occurs.</p>

        <h3>Two sides of payment areas</h3>
        <p>What often makes payment projects more difficult to work on, especially with startups who have not yet reached the product/market fit, is that they inevitably ask the tough questions: have you cracked the revenue model yet? Refactoring information architecture, refreshing visual and UI design and rewriting copy only gets you to a certain point. It's all worthy optimization, but most startups need to focus on big experiments, not optimizations.</p>
        <p>While I think great UX can do wonders, sooner or later a couple of questions take project to a new direction: Do customers really need your product enough to pay; Is your revenue model appropriate for the goods/services you're selling to this customer segment; Are you overcharging? It all makes these projects particularly difficult for the team.</p>
